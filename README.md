# FindTrail

FindTrail is a calm, local-first progressive web app for finding misplaced items. It turns a frantic whole-house search into one useful place at a time, remembers where items were found, and gently promotes likely locations during future searches.

Version 2.8 finishes the product's memory and control surfaces. History now turns found-item records into clear learned-place shortcuts, expandable search details, and one-tap repeat searches. Settings now groups search guidance, appearance, saved homes, privacy, backup, and destructive controls by intent instead of presenting one long utility list. The production Home, Trail, Found, Still Missing recovery, 30-second feather-and-water reset, local voice, backup and restore, and update-ready notices remain intact.

## Product principles

- One decision or search area at a time
- Useful without an account, connection, or setup ritual
- Support attention without talking down to the user
- Remember patterns locally and explain why a stop is suggested
- Humor can lower tension; it must never shame the user
- Accessibility and reduced-motion support are release requirements

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Quality checks

```bash
npm run check
```

See [docs/QA_REPORT.md](docs/QA_REPORT.md) for the current release evidence and [docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md](docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md) for the remaining physical-device approval.

## Deployment

Merges to `main` are verified and published to GitHub Pages by the included workflows. A Cloudflare Workers static-assets configuration is also included for an alternate production host:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

## Privacy

Search progress, preferences, saved home spots, custom-item shortcuts, and found-item history remain in browser storage on the current device. FindTrail has no account system, analytics, advertising, or remote database. A portable JSON backup is created only when the user explicitly exports one.
